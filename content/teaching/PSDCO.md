The electric power system is a system that is never in steady state due to constant changes in load and generation inputs. This course is dedicated to the dynamical properties of the electric power grid including how the system state is estimated, generation/load balance is ensured by frequency control and how the system reacts in case of faults in the system.

The course starts with the introduction of general operational procedures and the discussion of state estimation which is an important tool to observe the state of the grid. The course is then dedicated to the modeling and studying of the dynamical properties of the electric power grid. Frequency control which ensures the generation/load balance in real time is the basis for real-time control and is presented in depth. For the analysis of how the system detects and reacts dynamically in fault situations, protection and dynamic models for synchronous machines are introduced.
