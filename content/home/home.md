### Welcome 

Electric energy is at the heart of our modern lifestyle and crucial to everyday economic activity. I work on making future energy systems sustainable, reliable, and resilient. I am interested in the transformation of traditional energy networks to future low-carbon systems; analysing their behaviour and developing the technologies to facilitate a secure and sustainable transition.

For more information, check my [About me]({{< ref "about-me.md" >}}), my [Full CV](files/Petros_Aristidou_CV.pdf), or my [university profile](https://engineering.leeds.ac.uk/staff/878/Dr_Petros_Aristidou).
