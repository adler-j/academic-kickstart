 abstract = {In this paper, an open-source MATLAB toolbox is presented that is able to generate synthetic, combined transmission and distribution network models. These can be used to analyse the interactions between transmission and multiple distribution systems, such as the provision of ancillary services by active distribution grids, the co-optimization of planning and operation, the development of emergency control and protection schemes spanning over different voltage levels, the analysis of combined market aspects, etc. The generated test-system models are highly customizable, providing the user with the flexibility to easily choose the desired characteristics, such as the level of renewable energy penetration, the size of the final system, etc.},
